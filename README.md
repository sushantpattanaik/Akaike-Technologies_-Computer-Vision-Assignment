Objective 1: Count the number of rice grains in the Image.
Objective 2: Find the number of broken grains in the image.
Sample Image:
You can assume the following in the image:
● The background will always be blue.
● There will be a mix of broken and non-broken rice grains.
● The grains will not overlap but can touch each other.
Data:
Please download the zip file from the below link
http://shorturl.at/zHJ07
The file will contain 2 folders train and test and a submission file.
The train folder contains 12 images with prefix:
● broken_grain_: contains only broken grains
● full_grains_: contains only full grains (non-broken grains)
● mixed_grains_: contains a mix of broken and non-broken grains.
The test folder will have 5 images on which submission needs to be made.
Computer Vision Assignment
Suggestions for Solution:
● Feel free to use any image processing techniques, libraries, external data.
● Try OpenCV based techniques.
● Try to solve the cases where grains touching each other.
● Try some neural network based approaches to segmentation and classification
Submission FIle Format:
Should be submitted as a CSV file.
At least one of total_rice_grain and total_broken_rice_grain columns should be filled for the
submission to be valid.
Submissions Instructions:
● Share the complete code along with the submission file.
● Provide a detailed write-up explaining the work, visualizations of the result, current
limitations, and next steps on how to improve the algorithm.
● Share the above-mentioned things in one zip file.
● In case of any opensource code, data, or research paper is used, it should be
credited to the author or the source.
● Any hint of plagiarism will lead to rejection# Akaike_computer_vision
